# Distance Calculator Radians

This is a distance calculator library which is expecting two obj, one is point from which you want to calculate distance and other is target, upto which you want to calculate distance. Each obj expects two keys 'latitude' and 'longitude', which can be parse as a string or number. It will return you the distance between these two points.

Note: Distance is calculated in kilometers.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/distance-calculator-radians) to install distance-calculator-radians.

```bash
npm install distance-calculator-radians
```

## Usage

```python
var distanceObj = require('distance-calculator-radians');

const pointObj = {
    latitude: 'point latitude',
    longitude: 'point longitude'
}

const targetObj = {
    latitude: 'target latitude',
    longitude: 'target longitude'
}
let distance = distanceObj.distanceCalculator(pointObj, targetObj);
```
